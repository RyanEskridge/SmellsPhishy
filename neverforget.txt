1. Install NodeJS if it's not installed already.
2. Git clone the GH project onto your local machine 
3. Open it in VSCode 
4. Run 'npm install' from the project directory to install the project's dependencies
5. Highly recommend running 'npm install -g nodemon' if you want hot refreshes. It makes development a lot easier because you don't have to restart the server every time you make a change. 
6. If nodemon is installed run 'nodemon app.js' to start the local server. If nodemon isn't installed, run 'node app.js' instead.
7. Open a browser and navigate to 'localhost:8080' and the site should be running locally
